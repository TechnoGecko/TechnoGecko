- ðŸŽ“ Began my coding journey with freeCodeCamp

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity, MERN, and Database technologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in the early phases of making a Date Planner App using the MERN 
stack (which is quite new to me, aside from React). 

- ðŸŽ® Continually working on a passion project in Unity called [Gnash](https://github.com/TechnoGecko/MicrobialNightmare).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to begin collaborating with other people and stop being a lonely self-taught dev. Always looking for:
    - Open-source projects
    - Web3 projects
    - That one weird game idea you had!
    - Other ideas? Try me ðŸ¤“

- âš¡ Fun facts: I'm a drummer/music lover, I love cooking, and I used to play a lot of video games before I started making them!
